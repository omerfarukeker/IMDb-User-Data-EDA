# IMDb Member Data: Exploratory Data Analysis

In this notebook we will explore an IMDb user's data. You can download your own ratings and much more information of the films you rated on IMDb (you must have an account there to do that). Go to your profile page and click on "Your Ratings" button. From there click on the three vertical dots and click "Export" which downloads your data in the .csv file format.
